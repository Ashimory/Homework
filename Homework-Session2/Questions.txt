1. A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.
Examples:
2 == 4 (false)
2 == 4 || 2 == 4/2 (true)
2 > 4 && 2 == 4/2 (false)

2. A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process.

3. Nested conditionals means placing, or embedding, conditional statements (if/else/else if) inside other conditional statements.
Example:
let age = Number(prompt("Enter your age here:"))
if (age < 18) {
    alert ("You are too young to buy and consume alcohol in Vietnam and in the U.S")
}
else {
    if (age < 21) {
        alert("You are old enough to buy and consume alcohol in Vietnam, but not in the U.S")
    }
    else {
        alert("You are old enough to buy and consume alcohol in Vietnam and in the U.S")
    }
}
